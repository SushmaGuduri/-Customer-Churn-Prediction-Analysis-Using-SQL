# -Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis-Using-SQL

This project analyzes banking customer churn data using SQL to identify key factors affecting customer churn. The analysis covers various aspects, including churn by geography, tenure, product ownership, and customer demographics.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to provide insights into customer churn patterns, helping banks improve their retention strategies.

## Dataset

- **CustomerId**: Unique customer identifier.
- **Surname**: Customer surname.
- **CreditScore**: Customer credit score.
- **Geography**: Customer's geographical location.

## Key Analyses

1. **Churn by Geography**: Analysis of churn rates across different regions.
2. **Churn by Tenure**: Examines how customer tenure affects churn likelihood.
3. **Credit Score vs. Churn**: Identifies the impact of credit scores on churn.
4. **Product Ownership vs. Churn**: Investigates the relationship between the number of products owned and churn rates.
5. **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzes churn patterns by gender, age, and active membership status.

## Key Findings
